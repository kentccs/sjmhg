                                <p class="t1">In the year 1997, some Christians from other parishes where self-help groups had started came to St. Joseph Mukasa parish, Kahawa West and introduced the idea to the parishioners of St. Joseph Mukasa, Kahawa West. The idea was received well by some Christians who started sensitizing others. In March 1998, the group started with 71 members. At this point, Caritas Nairobi staff visited the members, educated them about saving and taking loans. This created confidence to the group members. In April 1998, the first management committee was elected and headed by Mr. Anthony Muroki. The first parish priest, Fr. Thomas Barbero was very pleased by the group and assisted in creating awareness to the Christians. Many Christians embraced the group and became members.</p>
                                <p class="t1">Since then the group has made major strides in alleviating poverty among members. Currently, the group has an active membership of 1500; cumulative savings of Kshs. 55 million of which, Kshs. 28.2 million is invested in interest bearing government securities and over 40% is circulating among members as loans. In addition, the group has invested with Caritas Microfinance Bank, the first Catholic Bank in Kenya.
